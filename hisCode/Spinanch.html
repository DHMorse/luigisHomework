        <h1>Health Benefits of Spinach</h1>
        <h3>Why eating spinanch is so good for you.</h3>
        <p>

           Popeye was certainly justified in his love for spinach. This green,
           leafy vegetable is rich in certain nutrients that promote healthy
           vision, like lutein and zeaxanthin; carotenoid pigments that
           accumulate in the retina of the eye. Lutein and zeaxanthin are capable
           of absorbing blue light and can prevent a considerable amount of blue
           light from reaching structures of the eye involved in vision.
